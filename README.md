# Fruit-Quality-Assessment-using-deep-learning
This project focuses on automatically assessing the quality of fruits using deep learning-based image classification techniques. It classifies fruit images into three quality categories — Good, Bad, and Mixed — across multiple fruit types such as apples, bananas, guavas, limes, oranges, and more.
