# Fruit-Quality-Assessment-using-deep-learning
This project focuses on automatically assessing the quality of fruits using deep learning-based image classification techniques. It classifies fruit images into three quality categories — Good, Bad, and Mixed — across multiple fruit types such as apples, bananas, guavas, limes, oranges, and more.

# Features
 1.Deep Learning model trained on a dataset of 19,526 images.  
 2.Classification into 3 quality levels for 18 fruit classes.  
 3.Transfer learning using InceptionResNetV2.  
 4.Rule-based suggestions based on prediction output.  
 5.Confidence score display for each prediction.
