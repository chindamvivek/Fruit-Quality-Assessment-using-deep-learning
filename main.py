Welcome to the **Fruit Quality Assessment System**!  
This application uses deep learning to assess the quality of various fruits from an uploaded image.  
You will receive a quality prediction and AI-powered treatment suggestions.

---

### üîç Model Used:
- **InceptionResNetV2 (Pretrained)**

### ‚úÖ Features:
- Confidence Score  
- Rule-based Treatment Suggestions  

---

### üîß How to Use This App:
1. Go to the **Prediction** page using the sidebar.
2. Upload an image of a fruit (supported formats: **JPG, PNG, JPEG**).
3. Click **"Show Image"** to confirm the uploaded image.
4. Click **"Predict"** to get:
   - Fruit type
   - Quality assessment
   - Confidence score
5. Receive **AI-powered treatment suggestions** to improve or manage the fruit quality (based on rule-based logic).

### üåü Advantages of This System:
- ‚úÖ **Easy to Use**: No technical knowledge required ‚Äî just upload and click!
- ‚úÖ **Fast Results**: Instant classification with confidence percentage.
- ‚úÖ **Wide Fruit Support**: Supports **18 fruit categories** with multiple quality classes.
- ‚úÖ **Useful Suggestions**: Offers practical treatment advice for bad or mixed quality fruits.
- ‚úÖ **Accessible Anywhere**: Works on any device with a browser using Streamlit.
- ‚úÖ **Offline Prediction Ready**: All logic is handled on-device (post-deployment), suitable for remote or rural users.
- ‚úÖ **Built with AI**: Uses **transfer learning** for accurate and efficient predictions.

### üß† Technologies Used:
- **TensorFlow & Keras** ‚Äì for model building and training  
- **Transfer Learning** ‚Äì using **InceptionResNetV2** for improved accuracy  
- **Streamlit** ‚Äì to build an interactive and user-friendly web interface  
- **JSON-based Rule System** ‚Äì to provide smart treatment suggestions

### üìä Dataset Information:
- Total Images: **19,526**  
- Fruit Categories: **18 classes** including Apple, Banana, Guava, Lime, Orange, Pomegranate, etc.  
- Quality Labels: **Bad**, **Good**, and **Mixed**  
- Data Split: **Training (80%)**, **Validation (10%)**, **Test (10%)**  
- Each image is labeled with both **fruit type** and **quality** (e.g., `Banana_Good`, `Apple_Bad`, etc.)
